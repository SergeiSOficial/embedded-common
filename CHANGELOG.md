## [Unreleased]

 * [`changed`] `base_config.inc` to work with I2C and SHDLC at the same time.
               Changed hal implemantation locations and moved the uart one from
               the Makefile of the test in the sensor repo to here. Also changed
               the way how mux sources are included so they are only needed by i2c
               tests.
 * [`added`] Shdlc implementation. This implementation was immigrated from the
             `embedded-uart-sps` repo. Since it's general code which could be used
             by multiple sensors it makes more sense to interate it here. The
             Shdlc part also uses the files in `common/`. In addition to that
             it adds two `.h/.c` file pairs. First `sensirion_shdlc.h/c` which
             contains the shdlc implementation for Sensirion sensors. Sencondly
             `sensirion_uart_hal.h` and `sensirion_uart_implementation.c` which
             describe the hardware abstraction layer used by `sensirion_shdlc.c`.
             This hal can be implemented in `sensirion_uart_implentation.c` for
             the platform the sensor will be used on.
 * [`changed`] Structure of embedded-common. File names should be more logical
               and the spliting of the different parts of the code as well.
               Embedded-common now splites the code into three `.h/.c` file pairs
               and a configuration `.h` file.
               First there are the three files in `common/`. `sensirion_config.h`
               is similar to `sensirion_arch_config.h` from before. It contains
               configurations for the code to be edited by the user.
               Then there is the `sensirion_common.h/c` pair which contains helper
               functions which are not protocol spesific, at the moment it's mostly
               type convertions.
               Secondly there are the two other file pairs in `i2c/`. The pair
               `sensirion_i2c.h/c` contains all functions for the i2c
               implementation of Sensirion. `sensirion_i2c_hal.h` describes the
               hardware abstraction layer used by `sensirion_i2c.c`. This hal can
               be implemented in `sensirion_hw_i2c_implementation.c` which is
               located in `i2c/hw`. If no HW controller for I2C is present one can
               also implement the GPIO SW-I2C implentation in
               `i2c/sw/sensirion_sw_i2c_implementation.c`.


## [0.1.0] - 2020-11-04

 * First release with support for I2C using a HW controller or SW bit-banging, 
   with sample implementations for common platforms and helper functions.
